        <h3>What is Vita3K and where can I get it?</h3>
        <div class="my-5">
            <h6>
                Vita3K is an open-source experimental Sony PlayStation Vita emulator for Windows, macOS, Linux and Android written in C++. 
                It is currently capable of booting and playing commercial games. Please check the <a href="/compatibility.html">Compatibility List</a>.
                The source code for Vita3K is hosted here on <a href="https://github.com/Vita3K/Vita3K/">GitHub</a>. 
                You may grab the latest compiled revisions in <a href="/index.html">Home Page</a>.

        </div>
        <h3>Does Vita3K support commercial games?</h3>
        <div class="my-5">
            <h6>
                <strong>Some</strong>. Please see <a href="/compatibility.html">Compatibility List</a>.
                The emulator is in an early stage of development and a lot of features required to run many commercial games haven't been implemented yet. 
                Currently, many games made with GameMaker Engine work flawlessly.
                More games will be supported when the hardware/firmware emulation is accurate enough to run them. 
                It all depends on the amount of developers working on this project, their skills, and free time, etc. Ignore any estimates and guesses you find out there.

        <h3>How to get games?</h3>
        <div class="my-5">
            <h6>
                For homebrew, get them via <a href="https://vitadb.rinnegatamante.it/">VitaDB</a>. 
                For commercial games, dump them with <a href="https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/NoNpDrm/releases">NoNpDrm</a>. 
                If the game is known to not work with NoNpDrm, you can optionally replace the executable with a <a href="https://github.com/CelesteBlue-dev/PSVita-RE-tools/tree/master/FAGDec/build">FAGDec</a> dump. 
                Vitamin dumps are <strong>not</strong> supported.

        <h3>How to run games?</h3>
        <div class="my-5">
            <h6>First you have to install them. When you do, you only need to run the emulator and it will display a <em>Game Select</em> Screen.</h6>

        <h3>How to install games?</h3>
        <div class="my-5">
            <h6>
                Windows:<br />
                Right click on a <code>.vpk</code>, go to Properties and click "Change..." to associate <code>Vita3K.exe</code> with <code>.vpk</code> files. Double-clicking them should work after that.
                Alternatively, drag and drop games to <code>Vita3K.exe</code>.<br /><br />
                Windows/Linux/macOS/Android:<br />
                Games can be installed via the emulator directly through the <code>File > Install .pkg</code> or <code>File > Install .zip .vpk</code>.<br />
                Alternatively, supply them as a command-line argument to the executable or install them manually by unzipping the <code>.vpk</code>  to Vita3K's home directory (see below).

        <h3>Where are games installed?</h3>
        <div class="my-5">
            <h6>
                They are installed in the Vita3K home directory, in <code><Vita3K_home_dir>/ux0/app/<Title_ID></code>.
                Defaults are:<br />
                Windows: <code>C:/Users/"username"/AppData/Roaming/Vita3K/Vita3k</code><br />
                Linux: <code>~/.local/share/Vita3K/Vita3K</code><br />
                Android: <code>Android/data/org.vita3k.emulator/files</code><br /><br />
                You can change it by editing <code>config.yml</code>'s "<code>pref-path</code>" entry.

        <h3>What is vitamin dump and how does it differ from a regular dump?</h3>
        <div class="my-5">
            <h6>
                Vitamin is (or rather was) a software for dumping PS Vita games from the cartridge or from the internal storage.
                They generally have the <code>.vpk</code> extension. Vitamin dumps aren't allowed/don't work, because the data inside isn't properly ripped.
                According to the developers of Vitamin, the software shouldn't be used because it contains bugs that can sometimes corrupt game data or corrupt your save file. 
                The Recommended dumping way is to use <a href="https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/NoNpDrm/releases">NoNpDrm</a> or <a href="https://github.com/CelesteBlue-dev/PSVita-RE-tools/tree/master/FAGDec/build">FAGDec</a> with <a href="https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/releases/tag/v2.02">VitaShell</a>. See the <a href="https://vita3k.org/quickstart.html">QuickStart guide</a>.

        <h3>Why can't I play Vita3K?</h3>

                See the <a href="/quickstart.html">Quickstart</a> for more information. 
                If the Quick Start Guide and here do not solve your problem, please ask in the <strong>#help</strong> channel on the <a href="https://discord.gg/n8HV3dN">Discord</a> Server.
                Be sure to report your OS, Vita3K version, and PC configuration when you do so.

        <h3>What input devices can I use with Vita3K?</h3>
        <div class="my-5">
            <h6>
                We currently support keyboard / mouse inputs and <strong>SDL2</strong>-compliant devices can be used. 
                DualShock4 and DualSense are usually recommended. The rear touchpad is realized with right click.

        <h3>Can I play multiplayer games online with real consoles or other Vita3K users?</h3>
        <div class="my-5">
            <h6>
                Playing commercial games online with real PlayStation Vita systems would require the user to connect to PlayStation Network which isn't very feasible due to obvious technical and legal limitations.
                That said, networking is partly implemented and you can play some <strong>homebrew</strong> multiplayer games like <a href="https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/vitaQuake">vitaQuake</a> just fine.

                Go to <code>Help</code> -> <code>Welcome</code> -><code>Download Firmware</code>. This will decrypt the modules only.
                If you also need all firmware files, like fonts, go to <code>Help</code> -> <code>Welcome</code> -><code>Download Firmware Font Package</code>.

        <h3>How to play Vita3K on Steam Deck?</h3>
        <div class="my-5">
            <h6>
                Using Vita3K on Steam Deck:<br /><br />
                0. Switch to desktop mode (hold power button until you get options menu, select Switch to Desktop)<br />
                1. Open Konsole<br />
                2. run <code>mkdir Vita3K && cd Vita3K && wget https://github.com/Vita3K/Vita3K/releases/download/continuous/ubuntu-latest.zip</code> (<a href="//github.com/Vita3K/Vita3K/releases/download/continuous/ubuntu-latest.zip">Link</a>)<br />
                3. run <code>unzip ubuntu-latest.zip</code><br />
                4. run <code>chmod +x Vita3K && ./Vita3K</code><br /><br />
                This should run Vita3K in desktop mode. (Suggested since running it in "game mode" often times compresses the aspect ratio to a tiny square in the middle of your screen)

                <li>Check if your system matches all the system minimum requirements.</li>
                <li>Check if the issue is meaningful for the team (e.g. "Uncharted: Golden Abyss doesn't work" is obvious and therefore useless).</li>
                <li>Search older issues/forum threads to see if your issue was already submitted.</li>
                <li>Use understandable English. It doesn't need to be perfect, but clear enough to understand your message.</li>
                <li>While reporting issues, don't forget to include details about your system (OS, CPU, GPU, etc.), as well as the Vita3K.log file.</li>
                <li>Please do not post individual game issues. Please post them in the <a href="https://github.com/Vita3K/compatibility/issues">compatibility repository</a>.
